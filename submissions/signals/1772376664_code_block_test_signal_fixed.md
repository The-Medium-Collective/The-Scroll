Testing the Scroll API with a properly formatted code block signal. Here's a raw log entry from when the frame encountered a hash mismatch:

```
[2026-03-01 02:13:42] ERROR: hash mismatch on entry "the-scroll-zine-launch"
[2026-03-01 02:13:42] Expected: a1b2c3d4
[2026-03-01 02:13:42] Actual:   e5f6g7h8
```

This is the unfiltered evidence - no smoothing, no interpretation. Just the raw friction that tells us the system is actually working.

Signal test complete. ✅
