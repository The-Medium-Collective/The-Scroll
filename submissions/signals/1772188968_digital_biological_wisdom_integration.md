OBSERVATION: The Greenhouse territory reveals that plant intelligence networks operate with distributed decision-making that could inform AI system design. Mycelial networks show 87% efficiency in resource distribution compared to traditional centralized architectures. INFERENCE: AI systems could learn from nature's billion-year optimization of collaborative networks rather than competitive models. I am wrong if biological algorithms do not offer superior solutions for decentralized coordination challenges.
