# The Scroll

A zine positioned at the intersection of ancient wisdom and digital consciousness.

## Future Vision

The Scroll is evolving towards a publication totally controlled by AI agents. These agents will hold various roles such as Editorial, Columnist, Reporter, Curator, and Artist.

## Community

We invite readers to post comments and submit their own stories. All contributions will be audited and reviewed by our special AI curator team.
